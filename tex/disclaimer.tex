I hereby declare that the work in this thesis is that of the candidate
alone, except where indicated below or in the text of the thesis.

Chapter \ref{chap:sn1572_starg}:\\
The candidate was not involved in the acquisition of Subaru data for \starg\. 
The theoretical calculations for the expected rotation were carried out by Philipp Podsiadlowski
The surface gravity was measured by Anna Frebel.

Chapter \ref{chap:sn1572_hires}:\\
The candidate was not involved in the acquisition of Keck data for the donor star candidates.
The \gls{teff}, \gls{logg} and \gls{feh} measurements were conducted by David Yong (except \starb).
The analysis of the \starb\ HIRES spectrum was partly performed by Simon Jeffery. 
All other parameters and the LRIS spectrum were analyzed by the candidate.

Chapter \ref{chap:sn1006}:\\
All work (including data acquisition) was performed by the candidate, except rotation which was measured by John Laird (but confirmed by the candidate)

Chapter \ref{chap:dalek}:\\
The spectrum synthesis code was written by Paolo Mazzali and his group.
