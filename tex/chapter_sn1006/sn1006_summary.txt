intro
after not finding anything in sn1572. survey other remnants. compare to see if common feature exists.

sn1006 best possible candidate. closest. relatively young. very spherical. well studied. perfect opportunity to follow up 
why Type Ia?
sm star found in the middle of SN1006. interesting - a few other remnant that have been survied show stellar remnants. follow up shows it's a dudd. 

introduction to sections

observations
Photometric observations of the inner region (describe section) (in 2004). in 4 filters. 
data reductions including photometry.
subsequent choice of candidates based on a limiting magnitude of x around a center c with radius r. 
problematic candidate…..
limiting magnitude is Lr at 2.2 kpc was chosen because of marietta et al 2000.
radius r was chosen because of < 1200 km/s.
high resolution spectroscopy of mgb triplet. good for getting teff, logg, feh. 
observations taken 2009. data reductions with ESO pipleine…..

photometric analysis….
calculating temperatures using photometry… 

spectroscopic analysis
radial velocity
rotational velocity
first comparison of synthetic spectra against the observed ones.
spectral grid

conclusion
no rotating star found to L_R x
