\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

For millennia mankind has watched and studied the night sky. Apart from planets and comets it appeared as an immutable canvas on which the stars rested. It comes as no surprise that for ancient civilizations supernovae (which were very rare events, occurring only every few centuries ) were interpreted as important omens as they broke the paradigm of the unchanging night skies. As these events are so rare their origin remained a mystery until in the first half of the last century. \citet{1934PNAS...20..254B} suggested that \textit{``the phenomenon of a super-nova represents the transition of an ordinary star into a body of considerably smaller mass''}. For the last 85 years the supernova-branch of astronomy has been developing. There have been many advances, but there are still many unknowns. This thesis addresses two subfields of supernovae: The unsolved progenitor problem for Type Ia Supernovae as well as quantifying the nucleosynthetic yield and energies of Type Ia supernovae.


\section{Ancient Supernovae}
\label{sec:ancientsn}
Although supernovae must have been observed since the beginning of humankind, reliable records only exist for the last thousand years. There are however transient star sightings mentioned in older text. For example, \textit{Houhanshu} \citep{2006ChJAA...6..635Z}, mentions a new star which was visible for 8 month (depending on the interpretation of the text it could also mean 20 months) in the year of AD185. This new star was reported to be in the \textit{Nanmen} asterism which is close to \gls{alphacen}.  Observations in modern times have revealed a supernova remnant in a distance of roughly 1\,kpc near \gls{alphacen} \citep{2006ChJAA...6..635Z}. Some believe this to be evidence that the star mentioned in the ancient text is  the oldest written record of a supernova, others however interpret this text as reference to a comet. 

The oldest undisputed record of a supernova is \sn{1006}{}, which also coincides with the brightest ever recorded supernova.  It was observed worldwide by asian, arabic and european astronomers. \citet{1965AJ.....70..105G} gives a good summary of the observations and interpretation given by these ancient observers. Ali Ibn Ridwan was an Egyptian astronomer who recorded the appearance of \sn{1006}{}. He wrote in a comment on Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos: 
\begin{quote}
\textit{``I will now describe for you a spectacle that I saw at the beginning of my education. This spectacle appeared in the zodiacal sign Scorpio in opposition to the sun, at which time the sun was in the 15th degree of Taurus, and the spectacle in the 15th degree of Scorpio. It was a large spectacle, round in shape and its size 2.5 or 3 times the magnitude of Venus. Its light illuminated the horizon and twinkled very much. $\dots$ This apparition was also observed at the time by (other) scholars just as I have recorded it.''}
\end{quote}

Only 50 years after the bright supernova of 1006 Chinese and Japanese astronomers reported on another cataclysmic event which was at first even visible during the day.  \sn{1054}{} might have also been observed in North America where petroglyphs in the Chaco Canyon could be interpreted as a depiction of this event (see Figure \ref{fig:sn1006_chaco}). The precise dating of these cave paintings is very hard but they were definitley created around the time of the \sn{1054}{} explosion. It is still debated if \sn{1054}{}\ was the inspiration of the painting or the inspiration came from the passing of Hailey's comet in 1066. More than 900 years later \cite{1968Sci...162.1481S} detected a pulsar in the center of SN1054. This was the first time that the stellar remnant connected with a known supernova was found.
\sn{1181}{} ends the 180 year period with three confirmed supernovae that started with \sn{1006}. This Galactic supernovae  first discovered in August of 1181 was visible for about half a year and was mentioned in eight different texts by Chinese and Japanese astronomers. 3C58, a pulsar found in \sn{1181}{}, is suggested as the neutron star remnant of this stellar explosion.

Humanity had to wait for nearly 400 years before the next bright event occured. Although the supernova was discovered by an abbot in Messina on 06 November 1572, Tycho Brahe is often quoted as the discoverer of this event. The attribution of \sn{1572}{} to Tycho came from his angular distance and brightness measurements of unprecedented precision (location to a few arcminutes!; see Figure \ref{fig:sn1572_tycho_chart}). These precise measurements proved that the star changed in brightness but stayed fixed like stars. Therefore Tycho concluded that this transient event was far beyond the moon where stars were suspected to be located. This broke the paradigm of the constancy of stars, which was believed by many. Having been studied for almost one and a half years the supernova finally faded from visibility in March 1574. The measurements of \sn{1572}{} among other astronomy related subjects were published in \cite{1602QB41.B73.......}. Another 400 years elapsed before radio emissions identified the remains of \sn{1572}{} \citep{1952Natur.170..364H}.

Kepler working with Tycho discovered \sn{1604}{} nearly 20 days before maximum occurring on the 28th of October 1604. Serendepitously around this time there was a conjunction of Jupiter and Mars, which was observed by many astronomers. This also led to an early upper limit were astronomers described the conjuction but did not mention the supernovae. As Tycho did before him, Kepler measured the location and the brightness of the supernova precisely \citep[see Figure \ref{fig:sn1604_ancient_lc};][]{kepler1606} before it faded from visibility 18 months later. Kepler was not the only astronomer observing \sn{1604}\ and there exist many texts from Korea and China mentioning this event. \sn{1604}{} was the last confirmed observation of a supernova in our own Galaxy. A good overview over these ancient supernovae can be found in \citet{2003LNP...598....7G}.

Observations in modern times have revealed two additional supernovae that must have exploded after \sn{1604}\ but are not mentioned in the literature. \gls{casa}, a supernova remnant, is the brightest radio source in the sky. It has been estimated that this supernova should have been visible between 1660 and 1680, however there are no clear mentions from astronomers in the seventeenth century. There has been much speculation to the reason (e.g. heavily obscured by interstellar dust and thus not visible), but until now it remains unclear why it was not observed. \citet{1984Natur.312..527G} detected another supernova remnant right in the heart of our Galaxy. Recent \xray\ observations revealed the supernova to be less than 150 years old \citep{2008ApJ...680L..41R}. This supernova happened very close to the galactic center and is heavily obscured by dust. At the time of explosion it was not visible at optical wavelength. 

In summary, the five ancient supernovae (\sn{1006}{}, \sn{1054}{}, \sn{1181}{}, \sn{1572}{} and \sn{1604}{}) were all observed without the use of a telescope. Our ancient astronomy colleagues had only very primitive means to observe supernovae, however the remarkably precise written records can be attributed to their ingenuity and assiduity. Even in an era of 10-meter telescopes the records of these explosions remain useful (see Figure \ref{fig:sn1604_ancient_lc}).

\section{Modern Supernova Observations and Surveys}
\label{sec:surveys}

The era of modern day supernova observations started with the discovery of \sn{1885}{}. \sn{1885}{} (also known as S Andromedae) was first spotted by Isaac Ward in Belfast in August of 1885 \citep{1885AN....112..360H} and was visible till February 1886. 
More than 50 years later \citet{1934PNAS...20..254B} coined the term supernova and established the difference between common novae and supernovae. \citet{1934PNAS...20..254B} also suggested that these luminous events are caused by the death of stars. 

In order to understand the phenomenon of supernovae better, Zwicky began a supernova search with the 18-inch Schmidt telescope. In these days the detectors were photographic plates, which were analyzed the help of  a blink comparator. This device permitted rapid switching between viewing two different photographic plates which were observed on different nights and one could easily detect \textit{new stars}. Using this method Zwicky found several supernovae which in turn inspired Minkowski to classify these supernovae by their spectra \citet{1941PASP...53..224M}. 
Minkowski categorized the 14 known objects into two categories. Those without hydrogen he called \emph{Type I}, those with hydrogen he called \emph{Type II} (see section \ref{sec:sn_classification} for a more detailed description about classification).

With the advent of computing in the 1960s the first computer controlled telescopes were built. A 24-inch telecope was constructed by the Northwestern University and deployed at the Corralitos Observatory in New Mexico with the express purpose of undertaking a \gls{dass}. While ultimately unsuccessful in finding supernovae, this search lead the way in computer controlled discovery and many later surveys would employ a similar design.

The advancements of detector technologies in 1980's such as photoelectric photometers and later \glspl{ccd}, coupled with increasing power and connectivity of computers enabled the construction of automated telescopes with minimal human interaction \citep[e.g.][]{1986IAUS..118...47G}. These first automated telescopes were used mainly for variable star surveys. 

The \gls{bait} was one of the first automated telescopes designed specifically to find supernovae. This search produced 15 supernova discoveries by 1994 \citep{1994AAS...185.7905V}, including the famous \sn{1994}{D}, pictured here (Figure \ref{fig:sn1994d}). Due to increasing light pollution in Berkley this project moved to the Lick Observatories and was named the \gls{loss}. With the switch to the new observatory the \gls{bait} was replaced with the \gls{kait}. \gls{loss} has been one of the most successful supernova surveys to date. By the year 2000 it had found 96 supernovae \citep{2001ASPC..246..121F}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page

   \label{fig:sn1994d}
\end{figure}

In the mid to late 1990's as high quality data on supernovae became available (mainly contributed by the \gls{ctss}) the long dream \citep[e.g.][]{1938ApJ....88..285B, 1960ZA.....49..201V, 1968AJ.....73.1021K} of using these objects as reliable distance indicators finally became viable. Two main teams drove the advancement in the cosmological distance measurements (the \gls{scp} and the \gls{hzsns}) and independently arrived at the same conclusion: the expansion of the universe is accelerating \citep{1998AJ....116.1009R,1999ApJ...517..565P}.

By the turn of the millennium and following the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe a variety of groups started large surveys specifically for supernovae. Among them were the \gls{essence} project and \gls{snls}. Both these programs have finished taking data, but have yet to publish all of their observations. Specialised surveys like the Nearby Supernova Factory \citep{2002SPIE.4836...61A} used an \gls{ifu} to capture light curves and spectra at the same time. The Higher-z survey \citep{2004ApJ...613..200S} focused on a high redshift range, available only through the \gls{hst}.

This effort is continued by a multitude of large sky surveys that started in recent years (or are just about to). Some of these focus exclusively on transients and supernovae like the \gls{ptf}, whereas others like the \gls{panstarrs} and \gls{skymapper} have a transient/supernova components. Upcoming surveys like the \gls{lsst} and the space-based \gls{gaia} mission will provide unprecedented detail about current supernova types as well finding several new classes of transients.

In addition to supernova searches in the optical, searches have commenced at other wavelengths and messengers. \glspl{grb} were first detected, as the name suggests in \gammaray s and are thought to be the bolometrically brightest  transients. The first detection of a \gls{grb} was on July 2 of 1967 by a Vela satellite. Vela satellites where designed to monitor \gammaray\ signatures of the then banned nuclear weapons test. It became quickly clear, due to the unusual form and direction of the signal, that these new \glspl{grb} where not of terrestial origin. Six years later the results from the Vela satellites were declassified and the existence of these \glspl{grb} made known to the world \citep{1973ApJ...182L..85K}. 

%Following on from the discovery of \glspl{grb} in 1973, 1000s of GRBs were observed by BATSE. A direct connection to SN was made via Beppo-Sax 9 as decribed via 98bw (underluminous), HETE-2 through 2003dh (normal brightness). This work continues with the SWIFT mission. 

At the beginning of the 1990's new high-energy instruments like the \gls{batse} surveyed the sky in \gammaray s and detected thousands of \glspl{grb}. \citet{1992Natur.355..143M} showed that \glspl{grb} due to their isotropic distribution are events at cosmological distances rather than coming from our own Galaxy. The \gls{bepposax} satellite, launched in 1996, was able to provid accurate positions for \glspl{grb}. This advancement led to the discovery that \glspl{grb} occur in distant galaxies, establishing them as one of the most luminous events in the universe ($>10^{52}$\,erg). The co-location of \sn{1998}{bw} and \grb{980425} established the connection between supernovae and some \glspl{grb} \citep{1998Natur.395..670G}. The subsequent \gls{hete2} mission established a new class of transients called \xray-flashes. These new objects are thought to be similar to  \glspl{grb} in the physical nature but much less energetic \citep{2004ApJ...601L.119Z}. This work continues with the \gls{swift} mission. 

Astronomy has been largely based on \EM\ waves, but there are other messengers of astrophysical information. Gravitational waves, predicted by the theory of general relativity  \citep{1918SPAW.......154E}, might provide us with another insight into supernovae. The most advanced detector today the \gls{ligo} has up till now not detected gravitational waves, although modelling indicates that it would have been highly unlikely to have an event close enough to have been detected by \gls{ligo}. \gls{aligo} will likely detect gravitational waves from in-spiralling neutron stars, and possibly core collapse supernovae. The \gls{lisa}, an ambitious mission planned for the coming decade is definitley sensitive enough to detect the predicted gravitational waves (a non-detection would show problems with the theory of general relativity). In the supernova field \gls{lisa} might give us an estimate on the number of in-spiralling white dwarfs, which are suggested as progenitors of \sneia.

\sn{1987}{A} was the first and only event that neutrino emission from a supernova has been measured\citep{1987PhRvL..58.1494B,1987PhRvL..58.1490H,Alekseev:1988gp}. New more sensitive detectors like IceCube \citep{2008ICRC....4..835K} will hopefully enable accurate neutrino observations of potential Galactic supernovae.

For now the optical observations of supernovae provide the bulk of observations of these transients. Hopefully future instruments and capabilities will enable us to combine measurements across the \EM\ spectrum with gravitational wave and particle flux observations, such an approach will unlock many of the secrets still held by these mysterious objects.

\section{Observational Properties of Supernovae}

\subsection{Supernova classification}
\label{sec:sn_classification}

The classification of supernovae started in the 1941 when Minkowski realized that there seem to be two main types \citep{1941PASP...53..224M}. Those containing a \gls{halpha} line he called Type II supernovae and those showing no hydrogen he called Type I supernovae. This basic classification has remained to this day, however the two main classes branched into several subclasses. During the 1980s the community discovered that most \sneia\ showed a broad Si II line at 6130 \AA. There was, however, a distinct subclass of objects that lacked this feature. These Silicon-less objects were then subclassed further into objects that showed helium -- now known as \gls{snib} --  and those that did not were called \gls{snic} \citep[see spectra in Figure \ref{fig:sn_classification};]{1987ApJ...317..355H, 1986ApJ...306L..77G}. The classical Type I supernova was renamed to \gls{snia}. Today we know that \sneia\ originate from the explosion of white dwarfs. \sneii\ and \sneibc\ are believed to stem from the collapsing core of a massive star.

   \caption{Spectral comparison from \citet{2003LNP...598...21T}}
   \label{fig:sn_class_spectra}
\end{figure}

%This classification only uses static spectral features. In recent years, however, there has been a push towards also using the lightcurve and spectral evolution as classification parameters. \citet{2005ApJ...623.1011B} provide an overview of this subclassing of \sneia\ and suggest that there are two distinct subclasses of \sneia. As a parameter for this further partitioning they use the velocity measured from the Si II feature at 6130 \AA. Those with a relatively fast decline in this radial velocity they call \hvg\ (high velocity gradient) those with a slow decline rate are named \lvg\ (low velocity gradient). 

Only in the past two decades have we been able to explore the finer details of the \sneia-class. Most objects have a small brightness scatter and are referred to as \gls{branchnormal}. There however seem to be two distinct subclasses with extreme luminosities. The overluminous class we call \gls{91t} after the bright supernova \sn{1991}{T} \citet{1992AJ....103.1632P}. The faint supernova \sn{1991}{bg}\ \citep{1992AJ....104.1543F} is the namesake for the underluminous class (\gls{91bg}). The luminosity of \sneia\ also manifests itself in the spectra through the ratio of the \ion{Si}{2} absorption features at 5800\,\AA\ and the feature at 6150\AA. Whereas faint supernovae have a pronounced trough at 5800\,\AA\ the luminous ones completely lack this feature but show a strong absorption line at 6150\,\AA\ instead. Another spectral characteristic is the velocity inferred from the \ion{Si}{2} feature at 6130\,\AA\ (dividing the supernova in a \gls{lvg} and a \gls{hvg}). ??? I have read in a couple of papers that velocity is coupled to luminosity for faint supernovae????Faint supernovae are fast decliners both in velocity as well as luminosity \citet{2005ApJ...623.1011B}. The bright supernovae do not seem to have such a preference. A third subclass named after \sn{2002}{cx}\ \citep{2003PASP..115..453L} seems to contradict this theme. They decline slow and are faint. This subclass also shares spectral traits with the over luminous \glspl{91t}. \citet{2011MNRAS.412.1441L} have tried to measure the fraction of different subclasses from the \gls{loss} dataset. Figure \ref{fig:ia_fracs} shows the fraction of the different subclasses that would be expected from a purely magnitude limited search. In summary, although there are several different subclasses, the \snia\ as a class itself is relatively homogenous when compared to the different \sneii.

   \label{fig:snii_lc}
\end{figure}

\sneii\ span large ranges in observable parameters. We can divide the main class into four main subclasses. \sneiip\ have a relatively flat light curve after an initial maximum (see Figure \ref{fig:snii_lc}). In contrast the \sneiil\ have a rapid linear decline after the maximum. The third subclass is the \sniin\ which is characterized by narrow emission lines, which are thought to come from interaction with the \gls{csm}. Finally the \glspl{sniib} show strong hydrogen lines in their early spectrum, but evolve to become spectroscopically to be more like Type Ib supernovae with no hydrogen lines but strong Silicon and Helium lines. \sneib\ and \sneic\ (often referred to as \sneibc) are believed to originate from the same physical process as all \snii-classes - the collapse of stellar cores (often grouped as \sniiibc). The distribution of the different \snii-classes is much more uniform compared to the \snia-class where the \gls{branchnormal} \sneia\ dominate (see Figure \ref{fig:ii_fracs}). But the classes are also much less strict with numerous intermediate and some peculiar objects. For a more comprehensive review of the classification of supernovae the reader should consult \citet{2003LNP...598...21T} and \citet{2007AIPC..937..187T}.

\subsection{Supernova rates}
\label{sec:sn_rates}
The observed supernova frequency carries important information about the underlying progenitor population. In this section we will concentrate more on \sneia-rates but will mention \sneii\ and \sneibc\ where applicable.

\citet{1938ApJ....88..529Z} was the first work that tried to measure the supernova rate. By monitoring a large number of fields monthly, they arrived at a supernova rate by merely dividing the number of supernova detections by the amount of monitoring time and number of galaxies. This crude method resulted in a rate of one supernova per six centuries. 

Over time many improvements were made to this first method. Individual rates were calculated for different galaxy morphologies and different supernova types. To combine measurements from different galaxies the rate was normalised by dividing the supernova rate (measured by number of events per century) by galaxy luminosity \citep[e.g.][]{1991ARA&A..29..363V,1994ApJS...92..487T}. 

In recent years, however, rate measurements have been made in reference to mass and/or star formation, rather than just galaxy luminosity (\sn\ per century per $10^{10}$\,\msun).  The community \citep[e.g.][]{2005A&A...433..807M} subsequently switched from B-Band photometry to the use of infrared photometry as the \gls{nir} is thought to better represent star-formation.  \citep[B-Band photometry does not separate between mass and star formation;][]{2003A&A...410...83H}. 
\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapter_intro/plots/snrates_mannucci05.pdf} 
   \caption[Supernova rate versus galaxy morphology]{The plot shows the estimated supernova rate per unit mass in different galaxy morphologies \citep{2005A&A...433..807M}. From left to right we plot old elliptical galaxies, lenticular galaxies, spiral galaxies and irregular galaxies. There have been no detections of \glsentryplural{snibc} and \glsentryplural{snii} in old elliptical galaxies which suggests that these types only occur in galaxies with recent star-formation.}
   \label{fig:snrates_mannucci05}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:snrates_mannucci05} plots the rate of supernovae per solar mass of material versus the galaxy morphology. The data clearly shows that there is a strong connection between morphology and supernova rates. For a long time it was realised that \sneii\ and \sneibc\ occured preferentially in galaxies with active star formation, whereas \sneia\ occurred in all galaxy types. This indicated that \sneia\ and \sneiiibc have different progenitors - with \sneiiibc being related to young and presumably massive stars, and \sneia\ coming from a population of older stars. Theoretical calculations confirmed the view that stars larger than 8 \msun\ should explode in a process known as core collapse (leading to \sneiiibc), whereas white dwarf stars exceeding the \gls{mchan} might explode as a \snia. 
 The view on massive stars was confirmed when the progenitor of \sn{1987}{A} was asserted as a massive star, along with the detection of neutrinos in line with theoretical predictions. The progenitors of SN Ia remains an open question, and a central topic of this thesis. Additionally, it seems the progenitors of \sneia\ occur in both young and old populations. This could hint that there are two main progenitor types one which occur soon after star-formation, whereas others take a long time between formation and explosion. 

To address this issue several groups have tried to measure a \sneia-rate that is completely independent of galaxy morphology \citep[e.g.][]{2006MNRAS.370..773M, 2010ApJ...722.1879M}. This so called, \gls{dtd}, measures the supernova rate over time following a brief outburst of star formation.
This technique requires a detailed knowledge of the star-formation history of these systems. Several new techniques are emerging that try to circumvent the intrinsically difficult task of determining star-formation for individual \sneia\ host galaxies \citep{2010MNRAS.407.1314M, 2010arXiv1010.5786B, 2008PASJ...60.1327T, 2010ApJ...722.1879M}.

Supernova rates and \glspl{dtd} are an emerging tool to constrain progenitors. New upcoming surveys will provide an abundance of supernovae and measurements of their environments.  However fundamental uncertainties still exist on the theoretical front to predict \glspl{dtd} from a given progenitor model.

\subsection{Light curves} 
\label{sec:intro_lc}
Light curves give important insights into the physical reactions occurring during the evolution of the supernova. \cite{1982ApJ...253..785A} for example deduced from the light-curve shape that Type I supernovae are eventually powered by the decaying \Co.

For \sneia\ the light curve can be divided into four different phases (see Figure \ref{fig:lightcurve_2002bo}). In the first phase the \snia\  rises to the maximum brightness. Although only a small fraction of \sneia\ have been observed in that phase, one can determine the time of the explosion by approximating the very early phase of a \snia\ with an expanding blackbody. The luminosity of this blackbody is 
\[L\propto v^2 (t+t_\textrm{r})^2 T\,,\]
where $v$ is the photospheric velocity, $T$ is the temperature of the fireball, $t$ is the time relative to the maximum and $t_\textrm{r}$ is the rise time. The canonical rise time of \sneia\ is 19.5 days \citep{1999AJ....118.2675R}. New measurements using light curves of nearly four hundred \sneia, many these from the \gls{loss} dataset, have however shown a shorter rise time (in B-Band) of 18 days \citep{2011arXiv1107.2404G}. The rise is very steep and the brightness increases by a factor of $\approx 1.5$ per day until 10 days before maximum. The \snia\ reaches the maximum first in the \gls{nir} roughly 5 days before the maximum in the B-Band \citep{2000MNRAS.314..782M}. During the pre-maximum phase the color stays fairly constant at B-V=0.1, but changes non-monotonically to B-V=1.1 thirty days after maximum. The \snia\ starts to fade but  a second maximum is observed in the \gls{nir} \citep{2008ApJ...689..377W}. \citet{2000ApJ...530..757P} and later \citet{2006ApJ...649..939K} have successfully explained this by fluorescence of iron-peak elements in the \gls{nir}. Light curves at late times can be used to probe the amount of \iso{Ti}{44}, but are complicated by light echoes \cite[e.g.][]{1994ApJ...434L..19S} and time dependent radiative transfer \citep{2005A&A...437..983K}. \citet{2009A&A...505..265L} hold the record for the longest observed \sneia\ with \sn{2003}{hv} which has been observed to nearly 800 days past maximum light.  

Arguably the most important use of light curves is their application in normalizing \sneia\ to standard candles (see Figure ??took figure with normalizing light curves out. should I put it back in again???). \citet[][]{1993ApJ...413L.105P} plotted the magnitude at maximum in different filters against the decline of the B-Band magnitude after 15 days (\dmb).  They found a strong linear relation with a very high correlation coefficient ($>$ 0.9). \cite{1995ApJ...438L..17R} refined the method by using a linear estimation algorithm. This method would deliver a distance modulus by finding the offset between a template and the supernova light curve. They calibrated this method against a set of \sneia\ with known distances. In recent years the role of dust extinction has gotten a lot of attention. New light curve fitting tools try to implement more complex treatments of dust extinction and are still under active development \cite[e.g.][]{2007ApJ...659..122J, 2007A&A...466...11G}. Recent work on \gls{nir} light curves \citep{2006ApJ...649..939K} suggests that the peak absolute luminosity is not influenced as much as optical light curves by the production of \Ni\ which depends on the unknown progenitor. Serendipitously the effect of dust extinction at these wavelength is also much less compared to optical bands. This has motivated some members of the community \citep[e.g.][]{2011ApJ...731..120M} to use \gls{nir} to calibrate \sneia\ to standard candles.

For a description of lightcurves of \sneii\ please refer back to section \ref{sec:sn_classification}.


\subsection{Spectra} 
\label{sec:intro_sn_spectra}
Spectra are much more detailed measurements of Supernovae than just lightcurves. They are however, observationally much more expensive. 

For all classes supernova spectra can be divided into two phases: the photospheric phase and the nebular phase. In the photospheric phase, the spectrum can be very well approximated by a dense optically thick core which has a black-body radiating surface with an optically thin expanding ejecta above. Photon creation is often negligible in the ejecta. The ejecta rather reprocesses the radiation field coming from the central photosphere. In the case of \sneia\ this central photosphere consists of layers of first \glspl{ime}, and then \glspl{ige}, heated by the decay of \Ni. For \sneii\ the central region of the photosphere is hydrogen rich, which is kept hot by the energy deposited by the initial shock, diffusing outwards. 

As the supernova expands the photosphere recedes inward in mass and the optically thin layer grows larger and larger. Once sufficiently expanded, the entire SN ejecta becomes optically thin, which is known as the nebular phase. This phase is dominated by strong emission peaks and no continuum. 


\subsubsection{SNe Ia spectra}
\label{sec:intro_sneia_spectra}
The time evolution of \sneia\ spectra is characterized by the photosphere shining through the ashes of the explosion. The inner core has nearly completely burned to \glspl{ige}, the shell above consists mostly of \glspl{ime} like sulphur and silicon. With the photosphere moving inward we first see \glspl{ime} before the photosphere goes deeper and deeper and shines through some of the core material. This onion-like structure can be probed by a method called supernova tomography. By modelling subsequent spectra one is able to reconstruct the individual shells of the supernova \citep{2005MNRAS.360.1231S, 2009MNRAS.399.1238H}. 
Modelling of \sneia\ spectra is an important part in understanding the explosion process of \sneia. Chapter \ref{chap:dalek} discusses this topic which was explored in this thesis.

Similar to light-curves the spectra have different phases. We will use the \gls{branchnormal} Type Ia \sn{2003}{du} to demonstrate the spectral evolution \citep[][]{2011MNRAS.410.1725T}. 

\paragraph{Pre-Maximum Phase}
In the pre-maximum phase the spectrum shows very high velocities (up to 18 000 \kms). There is a relatively well defined pseudo-continuum with strong \gls{pcygni}-profiles of \glspl{ime} and \glspl{ige} (see Figure \ref{fig:sn2003du_premax}). The \glspl{ige} seen at this early phase are mostly primordial as the burning in the outer layers  is incomplete and does not produce these elements. 


\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page

   \caption[Premaximum and nebular evolution of SN 2003du]{Premaximum evolution of \sn{2003}{du}\ \citep[Figures kindly provided by M. Tanaka;][]{2011MNRAS.410.1725T}.}
   \label{fig:sn2003du_premax}
\end{figure}

The \ion{Ca}{2} line is very prominent in the blue and often shows extremely high velocities at early times (in \sn{2003}{du} $v \approx 25000$\,\kms). There have been multiple suggestions for the cause of this unusual velocity, including interaction with Calcium in the \gls{csm} or high-velocity ejecta blobs \citep{1999ApJ...525..881H,2004ApJ...607..391G,2004ApJ...601.1019T,2005ApJ...623L..37M,2006ApJ...636..400Q,2006ApJ...645..470T,2007A&A...471..527G}. There is a strong \ion{Mg}{2} feature at 4200\,\AA\ which is contaminated by several iron lines. Silicon and sulphur both have strong features at 5640~\AA\ (\ion{S}{2}) and at 6355~\AA\ (\ion{Si}{2}). While the strong silicon line at 6355~\AA\ is the trademark of SNe Ia, the 'w' sulphur feature at 5640~\AA\ sets \sneia\ apart from their \sneibc\ cousins. It is believed that in these early phases one should be able to see carbon and oxygen from the unburned outer layers. There is the \ion{C}{2}-feature at 6578~\AA\ but it is normally very weak (if visible at all). The only strong oxygen feature is the \ion{O}{1} triplet at 7774~\AA. High temperatures that ionize a large amount of the oxygen as well as contamination by magnesium and silicon near the only oxygen line, often make it hard to constrain the abundance of oxygen well. In summary, large fractions of oxygen in the ejecta might not be a visible in \sneia\ specta. 

\paragraph{Maximum Phase} As the supernova rises to the peak luminosity, opacity from the large fraction of \glspl{ige} (especially \Ni) is suppressing flux in the UV causing it to be reemitted in the optical/IR  (see Figure \ref{fig:sn2003du_premax}). The velocity has now dropped to less than 10000\,\kms. \citet{1995ApJ...455L.147N} suggested that at these epochs the ratio of \ion{Si}{2} 5972\,\AA\ and \ion{Si}{2} 6355\,\AA\ is a good indicator for luminosity and can be an additional calibration tool for the absolute magnitude of individual \sneia.


\paragraph{Post-Maximum phase}
In the post maximum phase, the spectrum is increasingly being dominated by \glspl{ige}, as the photospheric velocity drops to less than 8000\,\kms (see Figure \ref{fig:sn2003du_postmax}). The spectrum continues to contain feature of \glspl{ime}, which are slowly overwhelmed by the \glspl{ige}.

\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page

   \label{fig:sn2003du_postmax}
\end{figure}




\paragraph{Nebular-Phase}
As the supernova fades, the photosphere recedes into oblivion. At this stage the spectrum is characterized by strong emission lines which are produced by the iron rich elements from the very core of the explosion (see Figure \ref{fig:sn2003du_postmax}). These are kept emitting by the thermalisation of gamma rays and positrons from the radioactive decay of \Co, the daughter of \Ni. The velocity has fallen under 5000\,\kms. 




\subsubsection{SNe II Spectra}
\sneii\ show much more variation in spectra across their class than \sneia\ . In this section we will only give a very general and brief overview over \sneii\ spectra and spectral evolution. 
Compared to \sneia\ the initial spectrum is a relatively undisturbed continuum (see Figure \ref{fig:sn_class_spectra}). The only strong lines visible are those of hydrogen and helium which are the elements present in the envelopes of the progenitors. 
As the photosphere cools, the spectrum is broken up into \gls{pcygni} profiles of strong resonance lines of \ion{Ca}{2}, \ion{Fe}{2}, \ion{Na}{1}, and elements like scandium from the close to solar composition envelope. The nebular spectra of \sneii\ are characterized by hydrogen, oxygen and calcium emission lines powered by the radioactive decay of \Ni\ in the core of the supernova, which energizes the large amounts of hydrogen as well as the intermediate mass elements synthesized in the star before explosion.

The evolution of both \sneia\ and \sneii\ spectra, described in this section, only referred to the optical part of the spectrum. A lot of additional information is available by studying other wavelength regions.

\subsection{X-Ray \& Radio observations}

Compared to the traditional optical astronomy, \xray\ and radio observations of supernovae are relatively rare. The information, however, carried in the very high and low frequency photons is invaluable to understanding various transient events. 

One mechanism to produce \xray\ and radio radiation is in shocks. When the expanding ejecta of supernovae hits the \gls{csm}   it produces synchrotron radiation at both these bands. There have been extensive radio and \xray\ observations of \sneii\ and \sneibc\ that detail the mass loss history of these massive stars. It is interesting to note that \sneia\ have never been detected in either \xray\ or radio which suggests that the \gls{csm} around these objects is not very dense (for more detail see Section \ref{sec:progenitor_constraints}). Jets are another phenomonen that is commonly associated with radio emission. The \gls{grb}-phenomenon has been suggested to be the relativistic jet launched from certain \snibc. It is believed that \glspl{grb} are visible when this jet points towards the observer (also known as on-axis) within the opening angle of the jet thought to be about 5 degrees in the case of bright \glspl{grb}. As they evolve, a \gls{grb}'s jet spreads and is thought after many months to emit isotropically at radio frequencies. This radio glow should be visible to both on-axis and off-axis observers. \cite{2006ApJ...638..930S} have started a campaign to find this isotropic radio emission and were rewarded when \sn{2009}{bb} showed radio emissions at late times  \citep{2010Natur.463..513S}. This signal was interpreted as relativistic outflow powered by a central engine and suggests an off-axis \gls{grb}.

\sneiiibc have long been theorized to emit \xray s at shock breakout \citep{1978ApJ...223L.109K,1974ApJ...187..333C}. To observe shock breakouts is technically very challenging as the supernova needs to be detected very early. SN2008D was serendipitously discovered during an observation with the \gls{swift} satellite's \xray\ telescope. \gls{swift} was in the process of observing another supernova \sn{2007}{uy} in the same galaxy when it picked up an extremely luminous \xray\ source \cite{2008Natur.453..469S}. Subsequent ground based follow-up revealed a brightening optical counterpart which turned out to be a \snibc. The \xray-flash is attributed to the theorized shock breakout.

Finally late time \xray\ observations also probe weak high energy emission lines of the decaying radioactive ash. These weak emission lines are only visible in late time spectra of very nearby supernovae so it comes to no surprise that they have only been observed in \sn{1987}{A} \citep{1987Natur.330..230S, 1987Natur.330..230D}. Radio and \xray\ observation of both kinds of supernovae are still in its infancy and will provide great help when solving the current mysteries surrounding all types of supernovae.

\subsection{Supernova Cosmology}
Early in the last century astronomers were trying to gauge our place in the universe. \citet{1926ApJ....64..321H} discovered that the Milky Way was not the only galaxy in the universe but found that there were several such galaxies much farther than previously suspected. He used, among other methods, the known intrinsic luminosity ($L_0$) of \gls{cepheid} variables and determined the distance using the observed luminosity ($L/L_0 \propto 1/r^2$).  In addition, Hubble found that galaxies that were further away had a higher velocity from the Milky Way than close galaxies \citep{1929PNAS...15..168H}. He suggested that the universe was in a state of constant expansion. Since \glspl{cepheid} distance measurements are only possible for very close-by galaxies, astronomers were feverishly searching for brighter more precise distance probes (also known as standard candles). The discovery that supernovae are distant objects \citet{1934PNAS...20..254B} motivated many astronomers to try to use them as standard candles \citep{1938ApJ....88..285B, 1960ZA.....49..201V, 1968AJ.....73.1021K,1990A&A...230...81L, 1990AJ....100..530M}. 

This culminated nearly 70 years later in another paradigm changing discovery. The accelerated expansion of the universe was discovered by two teams \citep{1998AJ....116.1009R, 1999ApJ...517..565P}, using the same principal as Hubble used to discover the expansion of the universe. The technology needed for such a precise measurement was however much more advanced. In the intervening 13 years, the discovery of acceleration has been augmented by measurements of the CMB \cite[e.g. WMAP7;][]{2011ApJS..192...18K}, Large scale structure \citep[e.g.][]{2011MNRAS.tmp..951B}, and more supernovae \citep[e.g.]{2011A&A...525A...7A} to come up with consensus Flat,$\lambda$=\gls{cdm} model of the universe \citep[e.g.][]{2011arXiv1104.1444S}
Since then other techniques have come to the same conclusion . Both \sneia\ and \snii\ have been used as cosmological distance probes:

\paragraph{SN II Cosmology}
\sniip\ have been first suggested as cosmological probes by \citet{1974ApJ...193...27K} who showed that the \gls{epm} could provide absolute distances to \sneii. \cite{1994ApJ...432...42S} were able to measure \snii\ distances in the Hubble flow, and found $H_0 = 73\,\kms / \textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. They used sophisticated models to predict the emerging flux, and the absorption velocity of weak lines in the spectrum to estimate the photospheric velocity.  \sniip\ have also been used as relative distance indicators ????(Hamuy 2000? sorry there's his phdthesis and a couple of others????? ), but are observationally expensive and not as accurates as \snia\ (15\% error for \snii\  vs 7\% error for \snia\ \citep{2006ApJ...645..841N}).

\paragraph{SN Ia Cosmology}
The story begins with \citet{1968AJ.....73.1021K} plotting redshift of Type I supernova host galaxies against the luminosity distance implied by their peak magnitude (assuming a peak luminosity of $M_\textrm{peak}=-18.59$). Although crude (scatter of 0.6\,mag), Kowal's measurement clearly showed that more distant supernovae where at a higher redshift. Roughly fifteen years later, the broad class of Type I supernovae was divided into three distinct subclasses (Ia, Ib and Ic). In the late 1980's many authors started to realize that the class of \sneia\ was very homogeneous \citep[][and references therein]{1992ARA&A..30..359B} making them remarkable  distance probes. Around the same time a danish team discovered the first very distant supernova at z=0.3 \citep{1989Natur.339..523N}. The \gls{scp} started to target high redshift (z>0.3) fields to use distant supernovae to study the deceleration of the universe (little did they know). The smart and successful strategy of comparing observations taken shortly before and shortly after darktime meant that they could discover a `batch' of supernovae at once and do follow-up observations  \citep{1995STIN...9629501P}. This `batch' mode was required to convince time allocation comittees on large telescopes (only very large telescopes could study distant supernovae) to award time to this seemingly high risk project. The \gls{ctss} started in the early 1990's and targeted only supernovae at low redshift ($0.01 < z < 0.1$). By 1995 they had produced 30 new light curves for \sneia\ measured with only \gls{ccd} technology to unprecedented detail \citep{1995AJ....109....1H}. Advances in standardizing the \snia\ candle were made by \citet{1993ApJ...413L.105P}. Phillips found that there was a tight correlation between the decline in luminosity and the peak magnitude of a \snia\ which made these objects unrivaled distance indicators. Convinced by the ability to calibrate \sneia\ \citep{1993ApJ...413L.105P} and the ability to discover them at high redshift  \citep{1995STIN...9629501P} a group of astronomers founded the \gls{hzsns}. 
Then the developments started happening in rapid succession.  Inspired by the method of calibrating peak luminosity with the decline of the supernova both \gls{scp} and \gls{hzsns} developed more precise ways to determine the intrinsic peak brightness. The \gls{hzsns} parametrized the shape of the light curve  in different bands as a function of their peak magnitude. This \gls{mlcs} using many different bands was able to include measurements of dust extinction. The \gls{scp} team used a different method of stretching light curve templates in time to match the observations. This method also was able to incorporate extinction measurements increasing the precision. Both methods were able to measure the distance of \sneia\ to a precision of $\approx6\%$. Using these new tools the \gls{hzsns} was first to make the baffling discovery that the expanding universe was not decelerating but accelerating \citep{1998AJ....116.1009R}. Separated by less than a year the \gls{scp} came independently to the same conclusion \citep{1999ApJ...517..565P}. This was in stark contrast to the earlier assumption and required a cosmological model that not only had gravitating matter but also a component which would work against gravity, now known as dark energy.


\subsection{Post-explosion observations of Supernovae}

In most cases for \sneia, \sneibc\ and \sneii\ the distance to the supernova is too large to make detailed studies of the remnants of these events in years post-explosion.

When supernovae, however, happen in the nearest galaxies - or our own, we have the chance of detailed post-explosion follow-up.
SN 1987A, which exploded in the close \gls{lmc}, provided an ideal candidate for follow-up post-explosion. Observations confirmed that a previously observed Blue Supergiant was not visible post-explosion \citep{1989A&A...219..229W} confirming that this massive star was the progenitor of \sn{1987}{A}. It was the first time a progenitor was identified with this `direct detection' method and since then many more progenitors have been unearthed post-mortem \citep[for a review see][]{2009ARA&A..47...63S}.

Modern X-Ray space telescopes provide data of exquisit detail to study the remnants of supernovae. Hydrodynamic and nonequilibirum ionization simulations of shocks from the supernova ejecta with the \gls{ism} can be used to measure temperature, elemental abundances and other parameters related to the state of the ejecta \citep{2003ApJ...593..358B, 2004AstL...30..737S, 2005ApJ...624..198B}. This technique of modelling has been used to scrutinize ancient remnants. Kepler and Tycho remnants have been unambiguously identified using \xray-spectroscopy to be remnants of \sneia\  with the models even able to distinguish between different types of \snia\ models \citep{2006ApJ...645.1373B, 2007ApJ...668L.135R}. This field is still at its infancy and future coupling of three dimensional models with \xray\ observations will help understand the explosions mechanisms for both physical types of supernovae: thermonuclear explosions and core-collapse of massive stars. 

Light-echoes are features that appear when light from a supernova scatters on dust in the \gls{ism}. This has been suggested by \citet{1940RvMP...12...66Z}, but only advancements in imaging techniques as well as digital processing made it possible to detect these echoes. \cite{2005Natur.438.1132R} pioneered this technique and found several of these echoes in the \gls{lmc}. Follow-up observations by \cite{2008ApJ...680.1137R} showed that it is possible to obtain a spectrum and identify the type of supernova with it. 
\cite{2008Natur.456..617K} subsequently observed the light-echo of Tycho's supernova (SN 1572) and identified it as a \gls{branchnormal} \snia, confirming the previous \xray\ modelling results. Future wide-field surveys will hopefully reveal many more of these light-echoes. Beyond classification, light-echoes can also be used for a three dimensional spectroscopic view of supernovae \citep[demonstrated on the example of \glsentryname{casa} remnant. see][]{2011ApJ...732....3R}.

Post-mortem observations of supernovae and their light-echoes, although only available for nearby events, provide us with unique insights into these events.  Light echoes give us direct information about the explosion, but are only available for a few thousand years post-explosion. Radio and \xray\ studies are possible for much older remnants.  \citet{2010MNRAS.407.1314M} have scrutinized remnants in the \gls{lmc} and can reconstruct the supernova history for the last 20,000 years. Coupled with star formation history estimates they can infer a \gls{dtd}.

\newpage
\section{Core-Collapse Supernova Theory}

All \snii\ and \snibc\ are believed to be powered by the collapse of the electron-degenerate iron cores of massive stars, as demonstrated by the direct detection of their progenitors on archival images in a number of cases \citep[for a review see][]{2009ARA&A..47...63S}. For the iron core to form there had to be several prior stages of evolution.

\subsection{Evolution of Massive Stars}  To understand the state of the star shortly before the supernova explosion it is imperative to follow its evolution. For the topic of core-collapse we will concentrate on the nuclear physics of a single massive star evolution. There is ample evidence that some \snii\ and \snibc\ progenitors are influenced by binary evolution \citep{1992ApJ...391..246P}, but this evolution is much more complex and is outside the scope of this work.  In this context massive stars are stars bigger than 8 \msun. This is the minimum mass for a star that is believed to explode in a \snii. Like all stars massive stars spend most of their lives on the main-sequence burning hydrogen. This happens via the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle and its various side-channels (e.g $^{12}C(p,\gamma)\rightarrow^{13}N(e^+\nu)\rightarrow^{13}C(p,\gamma)\rightarrow^{14}N(p,\gamma)\rightarrow^{15}O(e^+\nu)\rightarrow^{15}N(p,\alpha)\rightarrow^{12}C$). For a 20 \msun star this phase lasts for 8.13 \myr\ \citep[see][]{2002RvMP...74.1015W}.

As the star evolves it begins to ignite Helium which burns via the triple-$\alpha$ process to Carbon ($3\alpha\rightarrow\Carb$) and then to Oxygen ($^{12}C(\alpha,\gamma)\rightarrow\Ox$). Table 1 in \citet{2002RvMP...74.1015W} lists 1.17 \myr\ for this phase. 

Due to neutrino losses the stellar evolution is qualitatively different after helium burning. A neutrino-mediated Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the carbon-oxygen core describes the advanced stages of nuclear burning in massive stars \citep{2002RvMP...74.1015W}. This contraction is occasionally delayed when the burning of new fuel sources counter-acts the neutrino losses. The star in the end is composited of a series of shells that burn the above fuel and deposit the ashes on the shell below (see Figure \ref{fig:fusion_shells}). There are four distinct burning stages. Their principal fuels are carbon, neon, oxygen, magnesium and silicon.

\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{chapter_intro/plots/fusion_shells.pdf} 
   \caption[Shell Burning of a massive star before SN II]{Shell Burning of a massive star before \glsentryname{snii}. (Source  Wikipedia)}
   \label{fig:fusion_shells}
\end{figure}


In the carbon burning stage two $^{12}$C nuclei are fused to an excited state of magnesium which then decays slowly to $^{23}$Na (see Equation \ref{eqn:c_burning}).
\begin{eqnarray}
^{12}C+^{12}C\rightarrow^{24}Mg&\rightarrow&^{23}Mg+n \nonumber \\
	&\rightarrow&^{20}Ne + \alpha \nonumber \\
	&\rightarrow&^{23}Na +p \nonumber \\
	\label{eqn:c_burning}
\end{eqnarray}

Although oxygen has a lower coulomb barrier, the next nucleus to burn after carbon is neon. This layer is composed of  $^{16}$O, $^{20}$Ne and $^{24}$Mg and burns neon with high-energy photons from the tail of the Planck distribution ($\rm ^{20}Ne(\gamma,\alpha)^{16}O$). 

In the next shell there is a composition of mainly $^{16}$O, $^{24}$Mg and $^{28}$Si. The bulk nucleosynthetic reaction is shown in Equation \ref{eqn:c_burning}. 

\begin{eqnarray}
^{16}O+^{16}O\rightarrow^{28}Si&\rightarrow&^{31}S+n \nonumber \\
	&\rightarrow&^{31}P + p \nonumber \\
	&\rightarrow&^{30}P + d \nonumber \\
	&\rightarrow&^{28}Si + \alpha \nonumber \\
	\label{eqn:c_burning}
\end{eqnarray}

The last shell converts $^{28}$Si to \gls{ige}. The obvious reaction $^{28}\textrm{Si}+^{28}\textrm{Si}\rightarrow^{56}\textrm{Ni}$ does not take place, but is replaced by a very complex network of isotopes that results in \gls{ige} being synthesized.

\subsection{Core collapse} Before the collapse,  the core consists of iron peak elements. Neutrino losses during carbon and oxygen burning decreased the central entropy sufficiently so that the core becomes electron degenerate. Such a degenerate core, which is more massive than \gls{mchan} (adjusted for Y$_e$, entropy, boundary pressure and other parameters) and with no material capable of being burned, will collapse. 

There are two main instabilities that facilitate the collapse. As the density rises the Fermi-Energy becomes high enough for electrons to capture onto iron-group nuclei. This capture process removes electrons that were providing degeneracy pressure and reduces the structural adiabatic index. In addition, the temperature rises to values where the nuclear statistical equilibrium favours many free $\alpha$-particles. The nuclear binding energy of this  $\alpha$-particle rich state is less and the core does not gain sufficient thermal energy to hinder gravity from advancing the collapse.

The collapse eventually leads to nuclear densities, the hard nuclear potential acts as a stiff spring during the compressive phase. It stores up energy and eventually releases this energy resulting in a \textit{core bounce}.  Recent simulations, however show that the ensuing bounce shock is not sufficient for a \snii\ explosion with the shock loosing energy by photo disintegrating the nuclei it encounters (loosing roughly $10^{51}$\,\erg\ per 0.1\,\msun).

The energy for a successful explosion is now thought to come from neutrino energy deposition. This reinvigorates the shock and leads eventually to an explosion which ejects the envelope of the massive star \citep{1994ApJ...435..339H}. Several variants of neutrino driven explosion now exist, with the neutrino driven convention leading to something known as a Standing Accretion Shock Instability \citep[SASI;][]{2006ApJ...642..401B}, or acoustic g-mode oscillations \citep{2007ApJ...655..416B} . There is not yet a consensus on how stars more massive than 12\,\msun actually explode. Regardless, in most cases for stars < 15\,\msun, it is believe that a newly born neutron star is left behind in these explosions. 

 \citet{2002RvMP...74.1015W} provide a very comprehensive review of the theory of evolution and core collapse. In particular they go into more detail describing the scenarios after core-bounce.

\subsection{Pair Instability Supernova}
One alternate explosion scenario is the pair-instability supernova. This scenario is believed to only happen in stars with a helium core of more than 40\,\msun. After core helium burning the star starts to contract at an accelerated rate, and enters a regime of temperature and density where the energy goes into electron-positron pair production rather than raising the temperature. This leads to a structural instability in the star (where the adiabatic index drops below \sfrac{4}{3}), leading to collapse. This collapse, if significant densities are reached, will result in oxygen fusion, which eventually halts the implosion and the collapse turns into an explosion. For very high stellar masses it is believed that oxygen fusion does not provide enough energy to halt the contraction and the star collapses to a black hole.


\subsection{Type II Supernovae}
The observables of these stellar cataclysms are the light curve, spectra and for one case, even the neutrino wind. The supernovae goes through three distinct phases which can be observed. 

The shock-breakout is the first visible signal from the supernova.  \cite{1992ApJ...393..742E} calculated a duration for the  shock breakout of SN1987A to 180\,s, its  luminosity of $5\times10^{44}$\erg\,s$^{-1}$. 
Such a breakout thus far has been observed only once - in the case of the lucky observations of \sn{2008}{D} - a \snibc\ \citep{2008Natur.453..469S}. This star, more compact than \sn{1987}{A}, had a shock breakout of 400\,s with a luminosity of $6.1\times10^{43}$\erg\,s$^{-1}$.

Shocks in the ejecta and the decay of \Ni\ irradiate the expanding hydrogen envelope and the energy slowly diffuses out causing a plateau. \sniil\ do not have extensive hydrogen envelopes acting as energy buffers and radiate their energy much more quickly. After the photosphere moves through the entirety of the H envelope, the ejecta transform to become optically thin, the supernova suddenly drops in brightness, and then fades exponentially, following the 77 day half life of \Co, the daughter nuclear of \Ni. Some light might also be produced by shock interaction with the \gls{csm}.





\subsection{Type Ib/c Supernovae}
If a massive star looses all of its hydrogen envelope prior to core-collapse there is no plateau visible in the light-curve because there is no hydrogen envelope in which to deposit large amount of energy from the shock (like \sneiil\ which only have a very small hydrogen envelope). Instead the light-curve is powered by radioactive decay after shock breakout, with the energy diffusing out from the core. The missing envelope also causes the lack of hydrogen lines in the spectrum. This leads to the supernova being classified as Type Ib. If both hydrogen and helium envelopes are lost then the supernova is classified as Type Ic. 
This loss of envelope is presumed to be caused by stellar winds and/or binary interactions \citep{1992ApJ...391..246P}. 


\section{Thermonuclear Supernova Theory}
In this section we will discuss the theory of \sneia\ which are thought to be thermonuclear explosions of degenerate Carbon/Oxygen matter. The different progenitor scenarios leading to an explosion of a massive white dwarfs are discussed in Section \ref{sec:snia_progenitor}.



\subsection{Progenitors of Type Ia Supernovae}
\label{sec:snia_progenitor}

There are two basic scenarios for \sneia\ progenitors. The \gls{sds} has a white dwarf accreting from a non-degenerate companion until the white dwarf ignites leaving the companion \citep[first introduced by][]{1973ApJ...186.1007W}. In the second scenario,  the \gls{dds}, two white dwarfs merge and ignite leaving no stellar remant \citep[first suggested by][]{1984ApJ...277..355W,1984ApJS...54..335I}. 

\subsubsection{Single Degenerate Scenario}
The \gls{sds} assumes a binary system with one evolved white dwarf and one non-degenerate companion. In most cases this non-degenerate companion is thought to be a main-sequence to red giant star. There are also scenarios that involve "exotic" companions such as helium stars. In all cases, the companion (or donor) star is believed to have filled its Roche-Lobe and lose mass via \gls{rlof}.

An outstanding problem of the \gls{sds} is the accretion process.  As most white dwarfs are born with masses significantly less than \gls{mchan}, they need to accrete mass to reach the critical 1.38\,\msun. The accretion process needs to efficiently burn any accreted hydrogen into helium to  explain its absence in \sneia\ spectra. Theoretically, there is only a very narrow range of accretion rates that allows the white dwarf to accrete hydrogen, stably burn it and efficiently grow to \gls{mchan}. \cite{2004A&A...419..623Y} have suggest that rotation of the accreting white dwarfs might increase this very narrow parameter range.

 If the mass-accretion rate is too low, it causes nova explosions which are thought to eject more mass than the accretion prior has gained \citep{Nomoto:1982p451}. However, there are some systems (e.g. \gls{rsoph}, \gls{usco}) that have white dwarf masses close to 1.4\,\msun\ which undergo recurrent nova outbursts. It is very likely that these systems were not born with a white dwarf this massive, but that these white dwarfs have successfully grown in mass throught the accretion of material. This suggest that in some cases, despite nova outbursts, efficient accretion is possible. Too high accretion rates would cause the binary to be engulfed in an extended red giant envelope. The debris of such an envelope are not seen in \snia\ explosions. 
 
There are several possible identified progenitor systems. A class of binaries called \gls{sss} with has a white dwarf accreting hydrogen from a non-degenerate companion at an appropriate rate such that hydrogen and helium burn hydrostatically. In cases where the \gls{wd} is a \gls{cowd}, rather than a \gls{onemgwd}, these objects are strong contenders for SN Ia progenitors \citep[][and references therein]{2006astro.ph..6364D}. Another subclass of possible \gls{sds} progenitors are \gls{amcvn} stars \citep{2005ASPC..330...27N}. In this type of cataclysmic variable, material is accreted onto the \gls{wd} from a helium star or helium \gls{wd} \citep{1992A&A...262...97V}. This scenario would conveniently explain the lack of hydrogen in \snia\ explosions . \citet[][]{2010A&A...514A..53F} have found a way to explode these systems in a \snia\ (see Section \ref{sec:snia_theory}).


\subsubsection{Donor Stars}

The \gls{sds} requires a secondary companion star (also known as donor star). If this companion survives the explosion it would be a calling card for the \gls{sds}. One consequence of this explosion is an unusual spatial velocity of the companion post-explosion. The main fraction of this velocity stems from the gravitational unbinding whereas only a small amount would originate in the kick from the supernova ejecta \citep[see Figure \ref{fig:han2008_vrad};]{2001ApJ...550L..53C, han2008}. \citet{2000ApJS..128..615M} have simulated the impact of \snia\ ejecta on a main-sequence, sub-giant and red-giant companion. In the case of the main-sequence companion, the supernova ejecta heats a small fraction (1-2\%) of the envelope which is lost post-explosion. \citet{2008A&A...489..943P} have repeated the simulations for the main-sequence companion and find similar results, but suggest that even less mass is lost. Post-explosion the main-sequence star should be very luminous (500 -- 5000 \lsun) and is expected to cool down over next 1000 -- 10000 years and follow the main-sequence track  \citep{2000ApJS..128..615M}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page

   \label{fig:han2008_vrad}
\end{figure}

For the sub-giant companion the simulations show very similar results to the main-sequence companion. The subgiant looses only a small fraction of the envelope (10 -- 15\%) and like the main-sequence star, it will be very luminous shortly after the explosion. After thermal equilibrium is established, the companion will return to a post-main-sequence track. 

The case of the red-giant, however, is different. \citet{2000ApJS..128..615M} suggest that it will lose most of its loosely bound envelope. Post-explosion core contracts and the temperature rises to more than $3 \times 10^4$\,K. The object may appear as an under luminous main-sequence O or B star. \cite{2009A&A...493.1081J} have suggested the population of low-mass single white dwarfs to be the remaining cores of such red-giant donor stars. This would result in a convenient explanation for the existence of these objects. 

One feature of surviving companions may be an unusually large rotational velocity post-explosion \citep[][Chapter \ref{chap:sn1572_starg} of this work]{2009ApJ...701.1665K}. Due to tidal coupling during the \gls{rlof}-phase, the rotational velocity  of the donor star, post explosion, is directly tied to the binary rotational velocity (see Figure \ref{fig:han2008_vrot}). Since stars of F spectral-type and later do not display such high rotational velocities, this feature is a very useful discriminant when looking for donor stars. 

\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page

   \label{fig:han2008_vrot}
\end{figure}


There have been several attempts to find these objects in ancient supernova remnants. \citet{1980ApJ...241.1039S} found a OB subdwarf star located 2.5\arcmin\ from the center of the remnant of \sn{1006}{} and suggested this as the donor star. Subsequent analysis by \cite{1997ApJ...477L..53W, 1983ApJ...269L...5W} however, have revealed strong \ion{Fe}{2} features with a profile broadened by a few thousand \kms and ionized redshifted silicon features. In the very likely case that these features are caused by the remnant this indicates the star to be located behind the remnant rather than being involved in the \snia explosion as a donor star.
 
The search of donor stars in ancient remnants is one of the main parts of this thesis and we direct the reader to Chapter \ref{chap:sn1572_starg} and Chapter \ref{chap:sn1572_hires}.



\subsubsection{Double Degenerate Scenario}
\citet{1984ApJ...277..355W} and \citet{1984ApJS...54..335I} were the first to suggest merging white dwarfs as progenitors for \snia. There are several advantages to the \gls{dds}. For example, it naturally explains the lack of hydrogen in \snia\ spectra. The accretion problem encountered in the \gls{sds} is dispensed with in the gls{dds}, as long as the sum of masses of both \gls{cowd}'s is above \gls{mchan}. 

One problem with this scenario, however, is that most \snia\ form a relatively homogeneous class. It is hard to reconcile this fact with the merger of two white dwarfs with different initial masses, composition, angular momenta and different impact parameters. A potentially even larger problem, however, is that the accretion of the disrupted lighter white dwarf onto the more massive white dwarf is thought to lead to \gls{aic} rather than a thermonuclear explosion (see Section \ref{sec:white_dwarfs}).

\cite{2010Natur.463...61P} have simulated the merger of two equal-mass white dwarfs (0.9\,\msun) and conclude that the outcomes of these mergers might be subluminous \sneia.

In summary, mergers of white dwarfs might be able to explain some of the \snia\ class. It is however still debated if these events are responsible for the abundance \gls{branchnormal} \sneia. 

\subsection{Evolution and Explosion of Type Ia Supernovae}

\subsubsection{White Dwarfs}
\label{sec:white_dwarfs}
\glspl{cowd} are thought to be the progenitor stars of \sneia. White dwarfs are among the most common stellar objects that are not composed primarily of hydrogen, which is consistent with the lack of hydrogen in \snia\ spectra. Furthermore, there is a clear theoretical avenue of exploding white dwarf stars, through accretion of material to near \gls{mchan}. It is general believed that these objects accrete matter (for the possible scenarios see section \ref{sec:snia_progenitor}) until they get close to \gls{mchan}. It is a delicate balance between ignition that results in a thermonuclear run-away and the \gls{mchan} threshold which would lead the collapse of the star to a neutron star.
 
There are three main classes of white dwarfs: helium \glspl{wd}, \glspl{cowd} and \glspl{onemgwd}. Originally \glspl{onemgwd} were called ONeMg WDs but the mass fraction of magnesium had been overestimated and thus now only oxygen and neon are mentioned \citep{1996ApJ...460..489R}. 

The accretion onto a helium \gls{wd} would lead to helium burning well before \gls{mchan} and thus these objects are not considered as potential progenitors. Although not considered as the \snia\ progenitor itself helium \glspl{wd} as companions to \glspl{cowd} are an interesting new suggestion as \snia\ progenitor systems (see Section \ref{sec:subchandra}). The ultimate fate of an \gls{onemgwd} is thought to be the collapse into a neutron star. Theoretical models predict that before oxygen can be ignited, electron capture begins in the core ($\Ne(e^-,\nu)\F[20](e^-,\nu)\Ox[20]$). Heating by the resulting $\gamma$-rays starts explosive oxygen burning. However, the electron-capture is much faster than the oxygen burning and promotes the collapse to a neutron star \citep{1991ApJ...367L..19N, 2005A&A...435..231G}. 

The favoured progenitor for a \snia\  are \glspl{cowd}. Theoretical calculations predict that these objects ignite when very close to the \gls{mchan} (1.38\,\msun). The vast majority of white dwarfs are born with masses around 0.6\,\msun\ \citep{2007MNRAS.375.1315K} due to the large abundance of  $\approx 1\,\msun$ stars compared to stars with a mass $> 5\,\msun$ which would turn into more massive \glspl{wd}.  It is however quite frequent to have \gls{wd} stars through mass transfer built up to more than 1\,\msun in binary systems with an intermediate mass companion ($ 2\,\msun < M < 8\,\msun$) . Such systems are thought to be the eventual progenitors of \snia.

\subsubsection{Pre-supernova evolution}
The white dwarf gradually accretes more and more material. Close to \gls{mchan} mild carbon burning ensues
\begin{align}
\nonumber
\Carb(\Carb,p) &\rightarrow \Na \\  \nonumber
\Carb(\Carb,\alpha) &\rightarrow \Ne \\ 
\Carb(\Carb,n) &\rightarrow \Mg[23],
\end{align}
but is mediated by photon and neutrino losses \citep{2005NuPhA.758..463L, 2007nps..book.....I}. As these cooling processes become less effective convection starts in the core and the energy output in the core increases. At this stage the thermal structure is largely controlled by what is termed \gls{urca} pairs. These reaction pairs consist of alternating electron captures and $\beta^-$\,-decays involving the same pair of parent and daughter nuclei. Two prominent examples which are important in pre-supernova evolution are \Ne[21]/\F[21]:
\begin{align}
\nonumber
\Ne[21](e^-, \nu) &\rightarrow \F[21] \\
\F[21](\beta^- \nu) &\rightarrow \Ne[21]
\end{align}
These processes can lead to either cooling or heating \citep{2005NuPhA.758..463L}.

At present, the pre-supernova evolution has proven difficult to model theoretically as it is likely to be nonlocal, time-dependent, three dimensional and stretches over hundreds of years. The exact conditions at the time of explosion are therefore poorly constrained, and all explosion models have to assume simple initial conditions. The main steps leading to the explosion follow.

\subsubsection{Explosion mechanisms}

\paragraph{Ignition} The \gls{urca} processes will dominate core evolution for the last thousand years until explosion. As the temperature rises to $T\approx7 \times 10^8$\,K \citep{2000ARA&A..38..191H} the convection time ($\tau_c$) increases and becomes comparable to the burning time ($\tau_b$). Consequently the convective plumes burn as they circulate. Once the temperature reaches $T\approx 10^9$\,K, $\tau_b$ becomes very small compared to $\tau_c$ and Carbon and Oxygen largely burn in place. This is the moment of ignition. As the convective plumes burn while they rise it is likely that the initial flame seed does not start in the center of the core. \cite{2005A&A...431..635R} have used multiple flame seeds in their three dimensional full star models.

\paragraph{Thermonuclear Explosion} After ignition, there has historically been two main options. The first option was the complete detonation (supersonic flame front) of the \gls{cowd}\ \citep{1969Ap&SS...5..180A}. It was quickly, discovered, however that this method burns the entire star to \gls{nse} (\Ni\ dominant),  and thus leaves none of the \glspl{ime} observed in \sneia. 

To counteract this problem, it was suspected that the star instead of detonating would deflagrate (subsonic flame wave, mediated by thermal conduction). The fuel in front of the deflagration gets rarefied by the energy from the flame, with hot light burning bubbles rising into the cold dense fuel creating Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (see Figure \ref{fig:snia_ddt_roepke2007} at t=0.72\,s). 
Detailed calculations show that once the deflagration wave has run through the star, the resulting production of \Ni[56] is lower than that observed in \sneia. More critically \glspl{ime} are left throughout the expanding debris, leading to an un-observed distribution of \glspl{ime} at low velocities \citep{2007Sci...315..825M}.

The currently favoured scenario is the one of delayed detonation. Here, the star initially burns like in the deflagration scenario with the inhomogeneities in the deflagration front producing hotspots. In these hotspots the temperature gradients are so high that detonation waves form, travelling throughout the unburned star but not penetrating the already burned nuclear ashes. This produces an event which observationally is a good match to the spectral evolution of \sneia\ \citep[e.g.][]{2009Natur.460..869K}. Figure \ref{fig:snia_ddt_roepke2007} shows clearly how the detonation wave wraps around the cold ashes over the course of the detonation. An open question is if and how these transitions from deflagration to detonation occur in \sneia.

The detonation wave wraps around the deflagration ash and consumes the cold fuel. (Image reproduced with kind permission of Fritz R\"{o}pke)}
   \label{fig:snia_ddt_roepke2007}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{sub-Chandrasekhar-mass detonations}
\label{sec:subchandra}
\citet{1992ApJ...386L..13S}, \citet{1995ApJ...452...62L} and \citet{2010ApJ...714L..52S} have explored the detonation of \glspl{cowd} at sub-Chandrasekhar masses. Most recently, \citet{2010ApJ...714L..52S} show that the detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass \gls{cowd} reproduce observed light-curves and early-time spectra of \sneia\ fairly well.

A significant issue in this scenario is the ignition. \cite{2010A&A...514A..53F} have suggested an explosion mechanism in which a surface detonation of a helium shell drives a shock-wave into the core. In the core this shockwave triggers an ignition by compression.  As an initial model they use a \gls{cowd} accreting from a helium rich companion building a thin helium shell around its CO interior \citep[described in][]{2007ApJ...662L..95B}. This helium shell is ignited and sends out a shockwave. As the helium flame spreads on the shell around the star it sends a shockwave into the core. Once the shockwaves converge off-center they create a the right environment for the ignition of a detonation wave (see Figure \ref{fig:subch_fink2010}.) 

This scenario reproduces the intrinsic luminosity variability in the class of \snia\ as each exploding white dwarf can have a different mass.

   \label{fig:subch_fink2010}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{super-Chandraskehar-mass detonations}
As well as sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions are conceivable, the community has also studied the explosion of white dwarfs with $M>$\gls{mchan}. There have been a small number of \sneia\ which were extremely luminous (e.g. \sn{2003}{fg}, \sn{2006}{gz}, \sn{2007}{if} and \sn{2009}{dc}) suggesting ejecta masses of much more than 1.4\,\msun. This raises the question why these objects do not undergo \gls{aic}.  \cite{2005A&A...435..967Y} suggest that through rapid rotation these objects will increase the \gls{mchan}. Another possibility is the merger of two massive white dwarfs. \citet{2010Natur.463...61P} however suggested, for the merging of equal-mass 0.9\,\msun\ \glspl{cowd} (a total mass of 1.8\,\msun), the resulting supernova would resemble the class of \gls{91bg} objects. A core collapse scenario for some of these events has also been constructed. The number of observed super-Chandrasekhar-mass supernovae is as of yet too low to define common characteristics or a class.


\subsection{Constrains for different progenitor scenarios}
\label{sec:progenitor_constraints}
The question of the progenitors of \sneia\ is a main part of this thesis and one of the most highly debated subjected in current \sneia\ research. There are various arguments for and against the \gls{sds} and the \gls{dds}, with some suggesting that both scenarios contribute to the class of \gls{branchnormal} \sneia.

Radio observations in the case of \sneia\ can for example reveal the shock interaction of the ejecta with the \gls{csm}. The \gls{sds} predicts a more dense \gls{csm} than the double degenerate scenario. \citet{2011arXiv1105.6188H} have stacked radio observations of \sneia\ in the visibility plane and have not detected any source. At present, it is not clear that this limit is in conflict with the \gls{sds}. Future stacked \gls{evla} measurements will push the limits substantially downr, and will hopefully provide constraints that will allow us to rule out one or the other scenario at least for some \sneia.

On the other hand however \cite{2007Sci...317..924P} have found a variable sodium feature using high-resolution spectra of \sneia. These hint at the evolution of the Sodium ionization state in the \gls{csm} caused by the variable \snia\ radiation field. A wind from the donor star would provide material with the right geometric distribution to reproduce these features. Recently \cite{2011A&A...530A..63P} have seen similar features in the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi. This could hint that recurrent novae with red giant donor stars might be responsible for some \sneia. 


\cite{2010ApJ...708.1025K} predicts excess in UV flux in the \snia\ light curve at early times. This effect depends on orientation of the system to the line of sight and the state of the donor. The effect would be biggest for a red giant donor star. \cite{2010ApJ...722.1691H} do not see this excess in the \gls{sdss} supernova set indicating that the red giant channel is not common for \sneia. A study by \cite{2011arXiv1106.4008B} using the \gls{snls} data set comes to the same conclusion.

It remains a mystery that \sneia\ do not show lines of Hydrogen which might be expected from the wind or stripped envelope in the \gls{sds}. \citet{2007ApJ...670.1275L} have searched in the nebular spectra of two \sneia\ for hydrogen and place an upper limit of 0.1\,\msun\ for both these explosions. On the other hand \citet{2011ApJ...730L..34J} suggest that a red giant donor could significantly shrink during the \gls{rlof} and the material stripped by the ejecta might be negligible. This would place the the stripped hydrogen below the current detection limit. 


\cite{2010ApJ...719..474D} have not found enough \gls{sss} to account for the rate of \sneia. In addition, \cite{2010Natur.463..924G} have not found enough accumulated X-ray flux from elliptical galaxies if all \snia-progenitors were \gls{sss}\ (assuming the X-Ray flux calculated for these objects is correct). The main caveats are that the \snia-progenitors might only be in the \gls{sss} phase for a short amount of time and at other times, these objects could be engulfed in a envelope, which would reprocess the produced \xray s to optical or infrared wavelengths. In stark contrast to the negative \xray-studies described above \citet{2008Natur.451..802V} have suggested that they found the progenitor of the Type Ia \sn{2007}{on} in \xray s. Further analysis has put this claim in doubt \citep{2008MNRAS.391..290R}. Although the detection might have been spurious, their technique remains promising: Following up \sneia\ in \xray-archives could detect potential \sneia\ progenitors in a pre-explosion \xray\ phase and could confirm the \gls{sss}-scenario for some \sneia.

Finding a donor star of the \gls{sds} in a \snr\ post-explosion, would resolve the question for the progenitor system at least in the searched remnant. The main work of this thesis investigates this technique and we will refer the reader to Chapters \ref{chap:sn1572_starg,chap:sn1572_hires, chap:sn1006}. 

Population synthesis together with observations of \glspl{dtd} are an important step in exploring the different progenitor scenarios. \citet{2008ApJ...683L.127H, Han:2004p444}  have explored the \gls{sds} parameter space and suggest when compared to observations that the \gls{sds} can almost explain the observed \gls{dtd} (for references on \dtd\ see section \ref{sec:sn_rates}). \citet{2009ApJ...699.2026R, 2010A&A...515A..89M}, however, have explored the \snia-rate using several progenitor scenarios (\gls{sds}, \gls{dds} and \gls{amcvn}). Both suggest that the \gls{sds} on its own can not explain the observed \sneia\ rate. The rate of the \gls{dds} seems to be much closer to the observed frequency. Possibly a mix of all channels is required to explain the observed rate. 


In addition  o the standard SD and DD channels, alternative scenarios are continually being explored. For example, a core-degenerate  in which a white dwarf merges with the hot core of a massive AGB star \citep{2011arXiv1106.2027I}. Another alternative is given by \citet{2011arXiv1102.4342D} and \citet{2011ApJ...730L..34J} who suggest that the accreting white dwarf would be spun-up during accretion. The ignition of these highly spinning white dwarfs would be delayed and the companion might have time to evolve  substantially from its \gls{rlof} phase. 

\citet{2010ApJ...722L.157V} explores the merger of two equal mass white dwarfs with a total mass less than \gls{mchan}. When coupled with the work on sub-Chandrasekhar mass detonations by \citet{2010ApJ...714L..52S}, this might actually provide a viable progenitor scenario. Its main advantage is the predicted rate of these low-mass white dwarf mergers might be high enough to reproduce the observations. 

In summary, the question of the progenitors of \sneia\ remains one of the most highly debated topics in \sneia\ research. We have not yet found a scenario that elegantly explains all aspects of the \snia\ phenomenon. More extensive and novel observations of \sneia\ and \snr\ will hopefully identify the nature of \snia\ progenitors scenario.



\section{Thesis motivation}
One of the most pivotal moments in astronomy in recent years was the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe by \citet{1998AJ....116.1009R} and \citet{1999ApJ...517..565P}. This discovery made \sneia\ the cynosure of the astronomical community. There has been many advances in recent years in the understanding of these cataclysmic events (explosion models, rates, etc.). One critical piece of the puzzle, however, has so far eluded discovery: The progenitors of \sneia. This work's main aim is to find evidence for one \snia\ progenitor scenario. The \gls{sds} proposes a white dwarf accreting from a non-degenerate donor star. All calculations suggest that this donor star will survive the explosion and would be visible thereafter. We have tried to find this companion in two of the three easily accessible ancient supernova remnants (SN1572 and SN1006). In Chapter \ref{ch:sn1572_starg} we have obtained spectra of \starg\ which had been suggested as the donor star of SN1572 \citep{2004Natur.431.1069R}. Although we confirmed some of the suggested parameters we could not reproduce the unusually high radial velocity which led to the claim.  We also showed that the star exhibited no rotation, at odds with the star being the donor star.

We revisited SN1572 in Chapter \ref{ch:sn1572_hires} with new observations of \starg\ and five other stars in the neighbourhood of SN1572. This work indicates \starg\ is consistent with a background interloper, and is likely not to be the donor star (although it is hard to completely rule stars out). We discovered a curious A-Star located right in the center of SN1572. Despite its a priori unusual parameters we are unable to reconcile this star (\starb) with any feasible progenitor model. 

SN1006 provides a perfect opportunity to search for progenitor stars. It is the closest known remnant of a \snia\ (2\,\kpc) and is largely unreddened. We have obtained 80 spectra of stars close to the center of the remnant and present them in chapter \ref{ch:sn1006}. Again we do not find any obvious donor stars. We have obtained spectra of stars around SN1604 but these are not presented in this thesis, but will be analysed as part of future work.

Progenitor hunts provide us with information of the scenarios pre-explosion. Spectra on the other hand help to unravel the happenings during and post-explosion. \cite{2008MNRAS.386.1897M} have developed a code that can produce synthetic \snia\ spectra from fundamental input parameters. Fitting an observed \snia\ is for the moment a manual task. This requires many days, if not weeks, of tweaking. The deluge of spectroscopically well-sampled \sneia\ from surveys is already upon us, with manual analysis of all of these spectra impossible. The information about the explosion hidden in the spectra is however crucial to our understanding of these events. In Chapter \ref{chap:dalek} we present our work towards automating this fitting process. We have tried a variety of algorithms to explore the vast and extremely complex search space. Working together with members of the computer science community we are exploring the use of genetic algorithms to solve this problem. This thesis does not attempt to completely solve this problem, but we present preliminary methods in \snia-fitting in Chapter \ref{chap:dalek}. When completed, we can apply this method not only to fitting \snia, but fitting different supernovae and to other areas of astronomy. 

In summary, this work explores two areas of supernova physics: progenitors and explosion physics. The hunt for progenitors has not yielded obvious candidates, but may suggest a rethinking of the `normal' \gls{sds}. The automated fitting of supernova spectra is in a preliminary stage. We have however shown that it is possible to explore the parameter space in an automated fashion. This will hopefully yield elemental abundances and energies for many thousand supernovae. The close collaboration with computer science community was very helpful and shows how important cross-disciplinary research is in this era of science.
